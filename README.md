# LearnByCode
This project is a set of packages which includes few code samples in java to address fundementals(mostly for interviews and to keep up with the fundementals) of java, programming, data structures, design principles etc.

As of now, the project is pretty raw state. I am going to add few additional fixes, cleanup etc. Also on plan are... 2) To add more desgin patterns 2) Some services 3)JUnits and spoke based functional tests 4) SWAGGER documentation 5)Gradle based build process 5)Groovy and Scala snippets 5) Enhancing the services using REST services security of OAuth2 framework. 6) Some additional work on SAML2 based SSO.

If you want, you can fork this project, enhance/fix/cleanup and send me the pull request, I will review and merge them.
Thanks.
S.
